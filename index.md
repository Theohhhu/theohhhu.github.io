## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), 
under the guidance of Prof. Xiaojun Chang.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on advancing the field of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). I am particularly interested in developing novel algorithms and libraries, driven to address challenges in heterogeneous-agent learning problems. My research has significantly advanced the domain of Multi-agent Systems, with a focused effort on
enhancing scalability, efficiency, and the implementation of cooperative artificial intelligence solutions.
