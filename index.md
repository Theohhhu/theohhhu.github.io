## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), 
under the guidance of Prof. Xiaojun Chang.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on advancing the field of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with an emphasis on scalability, efficiency, and applications in cooperative artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing novel algorithms and libraries, driven to address challenges in heterogeneous-agent learning problems. My goal is to contribute to the broader landscape of reinforcement learning methodologies.
