## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), 
under the guidance of Prof. Xiaojun Chang.

## Research Interests

I am deeply engaged in the realm of Multi-agent Systems, where my research is dedicated to enhancing scalability, efficiency, and cooperative AI through groundbreaking algorithms and libraries. I led the development of "MARLlib," a comprehensive library essential for multi-agent systems research, which is open-sourced and has gained significant popularity within the community. My research has significantly advanced the domain of Multi-agent Systems, with a focused effort on enhancing scalability, efficiency, and the implementation of cooperative artificial intelligence solutions.
