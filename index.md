## About Me

I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at the Adelaide University and, before that, a PhD student under the supervision of Professor Xiaojun Chang at the University of Technology Sydney.

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cooperative decision-making, and large language models (LLMs). I focus on building intelligent systems that can work together in dynamic, real-world settings—from satellite clusters to human-AI teams. I led the development of **MARLlib**, a widely adopted open-source library that helps researchers prototype and benchmark multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. More recently, I’ve extended my work to GenAI, creating **ProAgent**, a framework that uses LLMs to enable proactive and interpretable cooperation between agents and humans. Whether through scalable algorithms or applied systems, my goal is to make AI more adaptable, accessible, and aligned with real-world needs.
